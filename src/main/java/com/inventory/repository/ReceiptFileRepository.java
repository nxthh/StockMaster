/**
 * ReceiptFileRepository is responsible for ALL reading and writing of
 * receipt text files inside the data/receipts/ folder.
 *
 * OOP concept: SEPARATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES.
 * Just like ProductFileRepository and TransactionFileRepository, this is
 * the ONLY class in the whole application that knows where receipts live
 * on disk and what their file names look like. ReceiptService never opens
 * a file itself - it asks this class to save or load a receipt and lets
 * this class deal with the folder, the file name, and any I/O errors.
 *
 * Storage format: unlike products or transactions, a receipt is not saved
 * as structured data (comma-separated fields) - it is saved as ONE plain
 * text file per receipt, already formatted exactly the way it should be
 * printed/shown to the cashier. This keeps things simple: there is nothing
 * to "parse" back, the saved text IS the receipt.
 *
 * Each receipt is saved as: data/receipts/R0001.txt, data/receipts/R0002.txt, ...
